"""Atomic on-disk write helpers.

The eval harness writes several artifact kinds that downstream steps consume:
- `run` / `diff` / `diff-json` / `list --out` write JSON/markdown that the
  GitHub Action's `comment` step (D-009) reads via the sticky-comment workflow.
- `calibrate --report` writes the calibration HTML report consumed by JT.
- `drift --output` writes the drift HTML report read in browser or uploaded
  as a workflow artifact.
- `Dataset.dump_jsonl` writes JSONL golden files consumed by every other
  subcommand and by the pytest plugin.

`Path.write_text` (and `open(path, "w").write(...)`) are not atomic: SIGINT /
SIGTERM / disk-full / OOM between the implicit `open(..., "w")` truncate and
`close()` flush leaves the destination zero-length or partially written. The
downstream consumer then either crashes with a misleading `json.JSONDecodeError`
or, worst case for D-006's sticky-comment workflow, posts garbage to the PR.

`atomic_write_text` writes to a sibling temp file in the same directory,
`fsync`s, then `os.replace`s. Same-directory placement is load-bearing:
guarantees same filesystem so the POSIX rename cannot fall back to a copy.

This module is the package-level home for the helper. PR #49 originally placed
it private to `cli.py`; promotion here matches the `rag_kit/io_utils.py`
pattern established in `rag-production-kit#44/#45` and is the portfolio
standard going forward.

# Cap the target basename's contribution to the temp filename. The temp name is

# basename that is itself near NAME_MAX (255 on ext4/APFS) overflows the limit
# and the write fails with `OSError: [Errno 63] File name too long` — even though
# a plain `Path.write_text` of that same target succeeds (sibling of
# rag-production-kit#128 and mcp-server-cookbook#96). The base in the temp name
# is cosmetic (`ls`-ability); uniqueness comes from `NamedTemporaryFile`'s random
# component, so truncating it is safe. Budget is in BYTES (NAME_MAX is a byte
# limit) and we trim on a char boundary so multibyte names are never split
