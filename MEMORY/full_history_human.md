## 2026-05-11 — Issue #1: Golden dataset JSONL format

**Duration:** ~55 min · **Branch:** `session/2026-05-11-issue-01` · **PR:** [#8](https://github.com/jt-mchorse/llm-eval-harness/pull/8) (draft)

- Stood up the `eval_harness` package skeleton with PEP 621 / hatchling and a deliberately dependency-free dataset layer so it can be imported in CI sandboxes and downstream repos without dragging in API SDKs.
- Shipped `load_jsonl` + `Dataset.dump_jsonl` + `DatasetLoadError(line_no, reason)` plus a hand-rolled validator (no jsonschema dep). Canonical dump form (sorted keys, compact separators) gives byte-equal round trip on well-formed input.
- Documented the format in `docs/dataset-format.md`, shipped a 10-line factual-QA fixture with full provenance, and 15 pytest cases covering happy path, round-trip identity, and every malformed-line case the loader promises to catch.

**Why this work, this session:** Issue #1 is the foundational contract every other eval surface (#2 judge wrapper, #3 regression runner, #6 PR-comment Action) depends on, and it was the lowest unassigned `priority:high` in the repo at the start of the eval-spine build sequence.

**Open questions / blockers:** None — PR is draft pending JT review.

**Next session:** Start on #2 (LLM-as-judge wrapper) — natural consumer of `expected_outputs[i].kind == "semantic"`.

## 2026-05-15 — Issue #2: LLM-as-judge wrapper + calibration
**Duration:** ~80 min · **Branch:** `session/2026-05-15-1325-issue-02`

- Shipped `eval_harness/judge.py`: `Judge` class wrapping a single-method `Backend` Protocol (D-004), production binding `AnthropicBackend`, deterministic stub for tests. Strict `SCORE: ...\nREASONING: ...` parser with score-clamping.
- Shipped `eval_harness/calibration.py`: hand-rolled Cohen's κ + Pearson r (no scipy), tested against textbook examples; `calibrate(judge, rows)` runs every row through the judge and computes both metrics; `render_report()` formats the markdown with PASS/FAIL tag.
- Shipped 50-row `fixtures/calibration.jsonl` distributed across the score axis (clear-positive, partial credit, clear-negative, refusals, off-topic, subtle errors, edge cases). Honest single-labeler disclosure (D-006).
- Shipped `eval-harness judge calibrate` CLI: writes `docs/calibration_report.md`, exits non-zero if Cohen's κ < threshold (default 0.6).
- Wired up real CI: `ruff check` + `ruff format --check` + `pytest --cov` matrix on py3.11/3.12, replacing the stub `echo` jobs.
- Backfilled README "What this is" / "Calibration" / "Quickstart" sections; rewrote `docs/architecture.md` with the three-layer diagram and the calibration-flow diagram.
- Closed issue #1 with verification (PR #8 had merged the work yesterday but the issue stayed open because the PR body lacked `Closes #1`).

**Why this work, this session:** Every downstream eval (#3 regression runner, #5 pytest plugin, #6 PR-comment Action) depends on the judge layer; without calibration the judge is just a wrapper with no agreement-with-humans claim. Locking the four decisions (D-004 backend protocol, D-005 metric pair, D-006 self-labeled disclosure) prevents re-litigating in #3.

**Open questions / blockers:** Calibration κ measurement requires the operator to run `eval-harness judge calibrate` against a real Anthropic API once. The infrastructure is shipped; the report number itself is honestly marked pending in the README.

**Next session:** Issue #3 (regression runner with per-model diffing) — both `Dataset` and `Judge` are now shipped, so #3 is unblocked.

## 2026-05-15 — Issue #3: Regression runner with per-row diffing
**Duration:** ~60 min · **Branch:** `session/2026-05-15-1923-issue-3`

- Shipped `eval_harness/runs.py` (stdlib `sqlite3`, two tables `runs` + `rows` with a foreign key, idempotent `init_db`, `connect`/`write_run`/`read_run`/`latest_run_id_for_suite` helpers) and `eval_harness/runner.py` (`RunSpec`, `AnswerSource` Protocol with a `DatasetEchoSource` default, `run_suite`, `diff_runs`, `render_delta_ascii`, `render_run_json`). Two new core decisions: D-007 separates `AnswerSource` from the judge `Backend`, D-008 commits to SQLite for persistence.
- Extended `eval_harness/cli.py` with `eval-harness run --suite <name> --dataset <path> [--baseline <id>] [--threshold-drop X]` and `eval-harness diff --current <id> --baseline <id>`. The `run` command writes the per-run JSON to stdout (or `--out`) and the ASCII delta table to stderr when a baseline is available; it exits non-zero on any row dropping more than `--threshold-drop` (default `0.1`).
- 17 new hermetic tests across `tests/test_runs.py`, `tests/test_runner.py`, and `tests/test_cli_run.py`. The CLI smoke test against `fixtures/sample_factuality_v1.jsonl` finishes well under the issue's "<10s" acceptance criterion.
- Discovered + fixed an edge case during testing: two consecutive runs can share a 1-second-resolution `started_at`, so `latest_run_id_for_suite` now takes an `exclude_run_id` kwarg the runner uses after persisting the current run.
- 68/68 hermetic tests pass; ruff lint clean.

**Why this work, this session:** Every downstream consumer (#4 drift detection, #5 pytest plugin, #6 GitHub Action) needs the run + diff primitives. Locking the SQLite schema and the threshold-flag semantics now prevents re-litigating them in those issues.

**Open questions / blockers:** Real-Anthropic-API smoke runs require operator credentials; the hermetic suite covers the runner machinery itself. A real `AnthropicAnswerSource` is deferred until a consumer needs one — the Protocol is the contract.

**Next session:** Issue #4 (drift detection) or #6 (the GitHub Action that posts deltas on every PR) — both naturally follow from the run + diff layer.

## 2026-05-16 — Issue #6: GitHub Action posts sticky eval-delta PR comments
**Duration:** ~40 min · **Branch:** `session/2026-05-16-0400-issue-6`

- Shipped `eval_harness/comment.py`: `render_delta_markdown(report)` produces a GFM table with a hidden HTML marker (`<!-- eval-harness:sticky-comment -->`); `find_sticky_comment` and `upsert_sticky_comment` paginate the GitHub Issues API to find the bot's prior comment by marker and either PATCH it in place or POST a new one (D-009). HTTP plumbing is stdlib `urllib.request` — no pip dep.
- Two new CLI subcommands: `diff-json` (diffs two `RunResult` JSON files with no SQLite — D-010, picked because action runners are ephemeral) and `comment` (renders the delta JSON and upserts the sticky). `comment --dry-run` skips the API call entirely so local testing needs no token.
- Workflow `.github/workflows/eval.yml` runs on `pull_request`: installs the package, runs `diff-json` against committed `fixtures/demo_baseline.json` + `fixtures/demo_current.json` (chosen with one row in each of the five status categories — improved, unchanged, regressed-flagged, new, removed — so the comment table exercises every rendering path), then upserts the sticky comment with `permissions: pull-requests: write`.
- 19 new tests in `tests/test_comment.py`: 8 for the markdown renderer (marker placement, suite name, empty rows, table headers, flagged-row warning emoji, new/removed row em-dashes, run-id short rendering, headline-status switching); 7 drive `find_sticky_comment` / `upsert_sticky_comment` against an in-process stdlib `http.server` that mimics the GitHub API at the routes the bot uses (the helpers accept an `api_base` override designed for exactly this — no `unittest.mock` of urllib); 3 CLI end-to-end tests render the demo fixtures into markdown / JSON / dry-run output; 1 sanity test confirms there's no module-level token cache. Suite total now 87/87 green, ruff lint+format clean.
- README: new "GitHub Action: sticky eval-delta comments on PRs" section under Quickstart documenting the two-step CLI invocation downstream repos use.
- D-009 (sticky-marker identity, not author/title) and D-010 (`diff-json` JSON-pair operation, no SQLite) recorded.

**Why this work, this session:** #6 is the last load-bearing piece of llm-eval-harness's v0.1 — every downstream eval-consuming repo (rag-production-kit's #7, agent-orchestration-platform's #7, llm-cost-optimizer) needs a way to post eval deltas on PRs. Re-implementing the sticky-comment pattern in each repo would be exactly the duplication this package exists to prevent. With #6 shipped, those consumers just `pip install eval-harness` and add the two-step `diff-json` + `comment` workflow.

**Open questions / blockers:** None. The action runs on `pull_request` events; downstream consumers paste the two-step recipe from the README. A future "auto-update baseline on main-merge" workflow would close the loop but isn't on the v0.1 critical path — filing as `priority:med`.

**Next session:** All llm-eval-harness `priority:high` issues now closed. Move to a different repo — likely `llm-cost-optimizer` or `prompt-regression-suite`.
