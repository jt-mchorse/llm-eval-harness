"""Type-checking lock for ``eval_harness`` (#148).

``eval_harness`` ships a ``py.typed`` marker (#146), so its annotations are
visible to downstream type-checkers. This test is the in-repo half of the
contract: it runs the configured ``mypy`` gate over the package and asserts
it exits clean, so an annotation that drifts out of shape fails a test —
not just the (separately wired) CI ``mypy`` step.

The mypy configuration is the project's own ``[tool.mypy]`` block in
``pyproject.toml`` (non-strict baseline, D-016); this test invokes ``mypy``
with no arguments so it reads exactly that config, keeping the local test,
the CI step, and a developer's bare ``mypy`` invocation in lockstep.

Skipped (not failed) when mypy isn't importable, so a minimal environment
without the ``dev`` extra can still run the rest of the suite; CI installs
``.[dev]`` so the gate is always exercised there.
